# First Day of Winter Google Doodle
The First Day of Winter is all about welcoming in the winter season. The First Day of Winter is determined by the winter solstice, which is the day (within the entire year) that has the least amount of hours of sunlight. Therefore, the winter solstice is the shortest day of the entire year.
